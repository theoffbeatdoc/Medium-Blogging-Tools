# Medium Exporter
Export your stories published on medium.com to markdown.

## Why?

I really enjoy using [Medium](https://medium.com) to publish a few posts every now and then. But I also want to have a copy on my own blog which is using markdown.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions to make it work with other export formats that could be easily imported in other blogging engines.

## Installation

    npm install -g mediumexporter
    
## Usage

    $> mediumexporter https://medium.com/@xdamman/my-10-day-meditation-retreat-in-silence-71abda54940e > medium_post.md

To have a complete list of options:

    $> mediumexporter -h
