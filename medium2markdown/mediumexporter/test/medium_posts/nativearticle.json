Most publishers already have the majority of their traffic coming from mobile devices that have a limited bandwidth. Whereas on desktops people would be very forgiving about heavy web pages bloated with requests to 3rd party services (ad servers, widgets, etc.), on mobile it’s a different story. Loading a web page from the original publisher’s website takes between 5 to 30s on mobile. That’s forever.

The only losers here are all those ad servers.
