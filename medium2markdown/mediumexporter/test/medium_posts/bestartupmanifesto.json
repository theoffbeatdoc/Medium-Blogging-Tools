She’s got a very good horizontal view through her work at iMinds and now Startups.be, while I have more of a vertical view through doing one startup. She’s been focused on the Belgian/European startup scene, I’ve been focused on Silicon Valley, trying to learn from the best while still being connected to home through countless office hours with local startups. She’s a woman, I’m a man. She’s Flemish, I’m Walloon. I think that’s a pretty good start.
