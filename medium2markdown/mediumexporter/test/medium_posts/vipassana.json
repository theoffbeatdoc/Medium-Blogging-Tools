In a way, the Christian education I got was pretty much a top to bottom education. The truth comes from above and you need to accept it. Here, it’s a bottom up process. While you are being given some guidance, you need to come up with your own truth. You need to experience it yourself. That’s a bit like being a parent or being an entrepreneur. You can ask as many advice from people who’ve done it before, but it will never replace the experience of actually living it yourself.","markups":[]},{"name":"1edd","type":1,"text":"It also occurred to me that this bottom up nature of this teaching makes it particularly well suited for the 21st century where bottom up is increasingly replacing top to bottom hierarchies of the previous centuries.

You start with the breath and you start with a small triangle area between the upper lip and the top of your nose. By focusing on a small area you train your mind to become sharper and sharper. It’s like if you would slowly increase the resolution of a picture so that you can see more and more details.","markups":[]},{"name":"1d26","type":1,"text":"After a few days, you start experiencing new sensations in that small area. The goal is to experience first hand that everything in your body is constantly arising and passing away. And because of that, there is no point to feel aversion. There is also no point to crave for something. Everything is changing all the time. Don’t get attached to things, they will pass. Likewise, there is no such thing as “I” or “mine”. If you can detach yourself from your sensations (like pain), and if they keep arising and passing away, then they are never really “yours”. If you accept that nothing is ever yours, you will also feel much less pain whenever it’s gone, which will help you maintain your equanimity (the balance of your mind). The concept of no “I” is harder to grasp and I still have a hard time with it to be honest. I didn’t reach that far in my understanding in my meditation. It’s not with a 10-day course that you become enlightened. That would have been too easy :-)","markups":[]},{"name":"a077","type":13,"text":"The 4 main ingredients of Kalapas","markups":[]},{"name":"2823","type":1,"text":"Those Kalapas are the products of 4 elements. 2 physical elements and 2 mental ones.","markups":[]},{"name":"451e","type":1,"text":"The first one is food. That’s why it’s important to eat healthy. During those 10 days we only had vegetarian food (one of the rules we had to follow is to not kill any living being, and by eating meat you actually indirectly kill an animal). That was the first time for me that I would follow such strict diet for so long. And I have to say that I felt really, really good. My body just feels so much better. I’m not tired anymore after eating, I have much more energy throughout the day and I stopped drinking coffee.","markups":[]},{"name":"a8a6","type":1,"text":"The second one is everything else that your body captures on the physical level.

You become aware of all the reactions that you have that have become automatisms. Those predetermined reactions are called Sankharas. They are the fruits of our past experiences. Every time we have a reaction to something — a craving or an aversion — we build up a new Sankhara. They accumulate over time and consolidate into our subconscious. By meditating, they come up to the surface into our conscious mind. The way to get rid of them is not to ignore them but to face them, observe them objectively and let them go away. Because everything — even our thoughts —are arising and passing away, continuously.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":187,"end":196,"href":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%85kh%C4%81ra","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"921e","type":1,"text":"Day 7 I started to experience what we call a free flow of vibrations throughout the body.

Whereas Vipassana is all about focusing on yourself, looking inside your own body, here we are being asked to share our harmony, our peace and our happiness with not only our loved ones but also with all beings in general.
